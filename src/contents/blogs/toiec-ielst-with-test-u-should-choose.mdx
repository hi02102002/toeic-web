The TOEIC (Test of English for International Communication) is developed and administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) in Princeton, New Jersey. The TOEIC test is designed to gauge English language proficiency of those working in an international environment.

The TOEIC test links to Japan in that during the 1970’s, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry required ETS to design a test for corporations to use. They wanted to know at which level non-native English speakers can use English at the workplace. More than 14,000 organizations in 150 countries have used TOEIC as a way to test candidates’ English language competence.

The IELTS, which stands for the International English Language Testing System, is an increasingly recognized standardized English exam. The test is designed to measure the English proficiency level of those wanting to go on studying or working in an English speaking environment.

Most examinees are students wishing to continue studying abroad and people wanting to begin their international career. Up to now, over 10,000 organizations, both public and private have accepted IELTS.

There are around 3 million people sitting for the IELTS test every year, making it now become one of the most popular language tests in the world.

The IELTS exam includes two versions: IELTS Academic and IELTS General Training. While the former is for students wishing to enter higher education institutions abroad, the latter is for professionals who want to work abroad to certify their English level.

The IELTS exam is splitted into four skills: Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking. The Speaking test will take place in a face-to-face interview with an IELTS examiner. The IELTS band scores range from 0 to 9.

The IELTS General Training contains materials and topics from daily books, magazines and newspapers.

The IELTS is not a pass-or-fail exam and candidates will only get an overall score from 1 to 9.
